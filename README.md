Generate neural network architecture drawings given model file

# Automated Neural Network Drawing Procedure

### Step 1:
Add the ability to export the internal json of the model to the end of the following javascript files: import_prototxt.py, import_json.py, and import_graphdef.py

Use the following code:
```sh
with open('data.json', 'w') as outfile:
    json.dump({'result': 'success', 'net': net, 'net_name': model.name}, outfile)
```

### Step 2:
Create code to find the dimension of the model using the json produced in step 1.
See this link for a working example: [Github](https://github.com/rpalakkal/neuralustrate/blob/master/getDimensions.py) 

### Step 3:
Modify [NN-SVG](https://github.com/zfrenchee/NN-SVG) to generate a network diagram by passing through the network dimensions rather than by manually inputting the dimensions. Look at the [FCNN-SVG](https://github.com/zfrenchee/NN-SVG/blob/master/index.html) and the redraw function. Change the architecture variable to be equal to the output of the code from step 2(right now it is equal to the user input).

### Step 4:
Add a button on the Fabrik page to run the code from Step 2 and open the modified NN-SVG in a new tab.
